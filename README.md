# Bachelor thesis
We worked on a system that simulated a collaborative task:

Where our job was to constrain the motion of the system to avoid bad manipulability regions, e.g. when one of the arms would stretch completely:

But the workspace was constrained by 3 different robots, the two physical ones, and the simulated one.
So we needed to find the coupled workspace:

We used sampling of different poses of the simulated robot and corresponding poses of the real robots to create a discrete representation of the coupled workspace, and the corresponding manipulability of a given pose:

Based on that we created a "virtual fixture" that would add resistance to the user when they tried moving into a bad region of the workspace:

Then we did optimization of the workspace by varying the positions of the real robots relative to the one in simulation:

We used the avg. distance from a desired trajectory to the boundary of the workspace as a measure of how "good" a workspace was, and therefor the corresponding positions of the physical robots:

Then we tested a couple of different optimizers, namely Adam (gd), Nelder-mead (nm) and Particle swarm (pso):
